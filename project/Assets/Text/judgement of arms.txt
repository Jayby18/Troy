When his body, armor and weapons were secure. They had to decide who got his armor and weapons.
This 'battle' was called the 'Judgement of Arms'.

Ajax was a fierce warrior and had killed many Trojan men.
Odysseus was a wise leader and had come up with great strategies.
Finally they had come to a decision:
Odysseus recieved the arms of Achilles.
Ajax wasn't happy with that and he went on a rampage, late at night...
